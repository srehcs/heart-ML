# Heart Disease Prediction — Machine Learning Coursework

This ML project done in juptyer notebook using python has a corresponding detailed presentation to go with it.The presentation contains more appealing and detailed visuals & much needed context. Please inquire if interested. 

Note: I'm leaving out specifics / information so that this repository isn't easily discovered by future students and used for plagirism.


The project involved with obtaining a data set to further analyze and solve a pre-established prediction problem.

The set selected here was the 2020 annual CDC survery data of 400k adults. 
Information obtained was relating to their health status & personal key indicators of heart disease.

Why is it important? 
- According to the CDC, about 659,000 people in the United States die from heart disease each year (that’s 1 in every 4 deaths).
- Early detection has a significant impact on how doctors decide to treat patients, which can prevent further cardiovascular damage.
- Raise attention to individuals with early signs of heart disease.
- Help hospitals and caretakers to take priority on potential heart disease patients.

After obtaining the data provided by the CDC — the task remained of utilizing the data for an appropriate use.

This data was cleaned, resampled, tuned, and trained using various machine learning models.
